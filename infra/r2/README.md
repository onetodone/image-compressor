# Cloudflare R2

Originals and results are stored in R2 and accessed through the S3 API. Buckets are private; clients only use presigned URLs.

| Environment | Bucket |
|---|---|
| Development | `image-compressor-dev` |

## Bucket

- Location: automatic with the location hint *Western Europe*, close to the Cloud Run region `europe-west3`. No jurisdiction: it would change the endpoint host to `*.eu.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`.
- Storage class: Standard.
- Public access: disabled.

## API token

R2 → *Manage API tokens* → *Create Account API token*:

- Permissions: **Object Read & Write**, applied to the bucket only.
- Put the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key into `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and the account ID from the R2 overview into `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`.

## CORS

Browsers upload originals with a presigned `PUT` and download results with a presigned `GET`, so the bucket must allow both from the web origins, including the `Content-Type` header that the upload URL is signed with. Without this policy, uploads from the browser fail with a CORS error (`curl` is not affected).

Bucket → *Settings* → *CORS Policy* → *Add CORS policy*, then paste the policy for the environment:

- Development: [`cors.dev.json`](cors.dev.json) (`http://localhost:3000`).

## Lifecycle rules

Bucket → *Settings* → *Object lifecycle rules*:

| Rule | Prefix | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Delete originals | `originals/` | delete objects 1 day after upload |
| Delete results | `results/` | delete objects 7 days after upload |
